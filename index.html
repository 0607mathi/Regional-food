In this way, it ought to be treated with incredible regard. The physical body is called Annamaya Kosha, for example sustenance body, since body supported and develops by engrossing the energies from nourishment.</h4></marquee>

        <p>Tamil Nadu cuisine is a combination of different flavours from a mild tangy Sambar to a dose of hot and spicy Rasam. The cuisine is majorly dominated by the use of rice, lentils, spices such as tamarind, coriander, chili pepper, cinnamon, curry leaves, cardamom, coconut and much more.</p>

        <p>One of the largest cities in all of India, Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay) is located in the state of Maharashtra and is world-famous for its rich seafood and meat dishes. Mumbai is also known for its scrumptious street foods with dishes like Bhel Puri, Vada Pav, and Pav Bhaji. </p>

        <p>Here, you’ll find the Gujarati thali, a mouthwatering platter of sabzi or shaak (mixed vegetarian dishes), kadhi (sour yogurt curry with veggie fritters), dals, and steaming basmati rice and soft roti, or “rotli” as it is called in Gujarati</p>

        <p>Eastern India just might take the cake for most rain out of all the Indian regions. With a humid climate and extensive river and lake systems, fresh produce and rice are easy to come by.like bhaja and luchi play beautifully with creamy chickpea dishes like chana dal.

        <p>Finally, we come to Central India, including the states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh. The hot, arid climate leads to a (perhaps counterintuitive) preference toward chili peppers — the hotter the pepper (and the more you sweat), the cooler you’ll be! </p>

        <p>Kerala cuisine offers a multitude of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry and red meat with rice as a typical accompaniment. Chillies, curry leaves, coconut, mustard seeds, turmeric, tamarind, asafoetida and other spices are also used in the preparation.</p>

        <p>Rajasthan's cuisine has evolved to suit the state's harsh dry climate. Dishes are often made to be stored for several days and served without heating. Dairy products are used extensively due to scarcity of water, and liberal dousing of food with ghee (clarified butter) is regarded as a sign of prosperity. Unrefined regional grains such as millet and jowar (sorghum) are common as well.</p>

        <p>The food in Goa is dominated by seafood (of course, being a coastal state) and pork. The Portuguese influence shows up more obviously at dinner in the evenings, when roast beef may even be served (most Goans are Catholic, and as a result eat beef). Goan food also features elaborate puddings and cakes. </p>

        <p>Gujarat's cuisine is known for its slight sweet touch (at least a pinch of sugar is added to most dishes!) and is traditionally entirely vegetarian. This makes it a delight for those who don't like to eat meat. Rest assured you don't have to go to Gujarat to get lip-smacking Gujarati food. It's widely available in Mumbai.</p>

        <p>Bengalis and Odias LOVE fish! It's fried, stewed lightly with vegetables, or made into jhol (curry with thin consistency). Hilsa (ilish) is the most savored variety of fish in Bengal. Equally adored when it comes to food are sweets, usually milk-based. The most renowned item in Odia cuisine is perhaps dalma -- a hearty stew made out of lentils and vegetables.</p>

        <p>You'll find a significant Tibetan and Nepali influence in the cuisine of the mountainous areas of northern India, due to migration and proximity to the borders of these countries.</p>

        <h1 id="nei"><u>North East India :)</u></h1><br>

        <br><br>
        <p>Also very different to typical Indian cuisine, food in North East India is largely devoid of oil and masalas. However, it is hot and spicy! Rice, vegetables and meat stew make up most meals. Pork is very popular and beef is not forbidden. You'll also come across some rather usual ingredients, such as ant eggs, dog meat and hornet larvae.</p>
